# ZPLinux

<img src="./images/cmatrix.gif" width="500" height="300" />
    
A tailored Linux release for my 486 FreeDOS machine.

(Toolchain and distro built with Docker)

(Yeah, that's [cmatrix](https://github.com/abishekvashok/cmatrix) burning the 66Mhz CPU)

Comes in two lovely floppy diskettes.

## Changelog

**v0.1**

- Initial Release

**v0.2**

- Added `Real Time Clock` support in the kernel.
- Safer toolchain (without `LDFLAGS="-s"`) / binaries and `.so` are now stripped via` *strip --strip-unneeded` at the end of toolchain build process.
- Removed most of built static libraries - going fully dynamic whenever applicable.
- Copied libc.so to the modules floppy - the script now creates the symlinks for the interpreter `/lib/ld-musl-i386.so.1` and `/bin/ldd`.
- Non-boot diskettes are now `ext2` formatted.

**v0.3**

- Ported toolchain and build system to Nix (rest TBW)

## Kernel Configuration

Modules are a must - it's impossibile to fit everything into a floppy. The non-essential modules will be offloaded to the second floppy.

    - Enable loadable module support
    - Enable block layer
    - General setup -> swap 
    - General setup -> initramfs/initrd support (gzip only)

Some generic must-have features  

    - General setup -> Kernel Features (expert) -> printk
    - General setup -> Kernel Features (expert) -> PC-Speaker
    - Executable file formats -> ELF binaries
    - Executable file formats -> Scripts starting with #!
    - Device drivers -> Generic driver options -> devtmpfs

Processor configuration

<img src="./images/cpu.jpg" width="150" height="200" />

    - Processor -> Family -> 486DX
    - Processor -> Load address -> 0x400000

The motherboard supports both ISA and PCI, so...

<img src="./images/mobo.jpg" width="150" height="200" />


    - Bus -> ISA support
    - Device drivers -> PCI support

For the block devices, the machine uses SCSI/PATA.

<img src="./images/hdd.jpg" width="150" height="200" />
<img src="./images/cdrom.jpg" width="150" height="200" />

    - Device drivers -> Block devices -> Normal floppy support
    - Device drivers -> SCSI -> SCSI device support
    - Device drivers -> SCSI -> SCSI disk support
    - Device drivers -> SCSI -> SCSI CDROM
    - Device drivers -> SATA/PATA -> ATA SFF support
    - Device drivers -> SATA/PATA -> Generic platform device PATA support
    - Device drivers -> SATA/PATA -> Legacy ISA PATA support

For the VGA (module)

<img src="./images/vga.jpg" width="300" height="200" />


    - Device drivers -> Graphics -> Framebuffer support -> S3 Trio/Virge 

Filesystems (ext2, fat, vfat and ISO9660)

    - File systems -> EXT2                  
    - File systems -> CDROM -> ISO9660                  
    - File systems -> DOS/VFAT/etc -> MSDOS                  
    - File systems -> DOS/VFAT/etc -> VFAT                  
    - File systems -> Pseudo -> /proc                  
    - File systems -> Pseudo -> sysfs                  
    - File systems -> NLS -> Codepage 437                  
    - File systems -> NLS -> ISO 8859-1  

Mouse (module) and keyboard

    - Device drivers -> Input device support -> Keyboards -> AT
    - Device drivers -> Input device support -> Mice -> Serial 

Sound card (Vibra16 - ISA PnP)

<img src="./images/sb16.jpg" width="300" height="200" />

    - Device drivers -> PNP support -> ISA PNP   
    - Device drivers -> Sound card support -> ISA devices -> SB16 PnP    

Parallel port (module)

    - Device drivers -> Parallel port support -> PC-Style hardware  

PC speaker (module)

    - Device drivers -> Input device support -> Miscellaneous -> PC Speaker  

 TTY

    - Device drivers -> Character devices -> TTY
    - Device drivers -> Character devices -> TTY / Output messages to printk
